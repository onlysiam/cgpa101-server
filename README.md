# Getting Started with Hootstory

## Frontend

Put the files inside a folder, then simply run "npm install".
It will install all the dependencies.

Then run the app with "npm start".

ps. the system must have node.js version 14 or higher.

## Backend

I have used mongoDB for the database support. The system must have the mongoDB community server to run the webapp.

Like frondend, run "npm install" in the server folder. Then start the server with "npm start. It will automatically create a "hootstory" database in the mongodb server. Import the data.json file in the blogs collection.
Reload the UI. The data should be fetched auomatically.
